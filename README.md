Financial Distress Analysis
Project Overview

This project analyzes countriesâ€™ macroeconomic indicators to assess the likelihood of financial distress or economic collapse. Using data from the IMF World Economic Outlook Database (April 2025), it calculates key metrics such as debt-to-GDP ratio and classifies countries into Low, Medium, and High-risk categories.

The project demonstrates an end-to-end analytics workflow, from data extraction and cleaning to exploratory data analysis, risk scoring, and visualization.

Objectives

Identify countries at risk of financial distress using macroeconomic indicators.

Develop a risk scoring model to classify countries by financial risk.

Provide actionable insights for policymakers, financial institutions, and economists.

Key Features

Data Cleaning & Preprocessing: Handles missing values, duplicates, and ensures data consistency.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizes trends in debt-to-GDP ratios and other indicators using Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn).

Risk Scoring: Categorizes countries into Low, Medium, and High risk levels based on debt metrics.

SQL Queries: Aggregates data and computes key metrics for regional and global comparisons.

Interactive Dashboard: Placeholder for Tableau visualizations to monitor trends and compare countries over time.
